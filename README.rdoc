== Symposium

Symposium is a simple-to-use application to schedule groups of people for an event.

= Notes

Symposium was originally designed for a single-purpose use at Stevenson School (http://stevensonschool.org/). As such, this application is provided as-is and may not be useful for your specific purpose. However, updates and patches are welcome.

The code is not guaranteed to be very new or very good.

= Requirements
Rails 2.1.2
